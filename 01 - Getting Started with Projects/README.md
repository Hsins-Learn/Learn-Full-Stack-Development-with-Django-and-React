## Project Structuring

The requirement of this application is selling T-shirts online for winter and summer and we're going to built it up with Django (for backend) and React (for fronted).

Usually we can get started with the backend part and do the **brainstorming** session. Use the tools like [coggle](https://coggle.it/) for mind-mapping.
